                <p>Deutsch does a good job of exploring the extent that our experiance of the world today is the product of knowledge acumulation. You would not survive the night without clothes in Oxfordshire. Clothes are knowledge.</p>
                <p>We can build a lot more knowledge. As we do our understanding of what is normal will change. Breathing in space will be as normal as surviving the night in Oxfordshire.</p>
                <p>He also explores how to evaluate theories. We don't have a perfect criteria for this and he does a good job of building intuition of how to evaluate in the interim.</p>

                <p>Kant trys to find axioms for morality. Instead he does a very good job of exploring the inconsistancies that develop when you try.</p>
                <p>This has been taken further by Gödel and Wittgenstein. But to really get a sense of the real world errors Kant is invaluable.</p>
                <p>This line of thinking permeated science and philosophy for +2k years. If you haven't read this it's very likely that you are (as I was) implicitly assuming that the universality he was aiming has been solved. It's not and it's worth finding out why.</p>

                <p>Probability is a very big deal. It's also very new - see above.</p>
                <p>For most of human history we really really really didn't have a clue how to tackle this.</p>
                <p>Hacking charts the emergence of uncertainty and chance as ideas from ground zero. The constant rebasing of words is funky to read however it really hits home the point that these ideas are still stabilising.</p>

                <p >Nielsen played a key role in building quantum computing and this is aimed at helping physicists do research. </p>
                <p >If you swap "research" for "work" then this is the most incisive life advice I have ever read.</p>
                <p >He also has an interesting perspective on the challenge of balancing "problem solvers" with "problem creators". I think most people would probably be more comfortable with the phrasing "framing a problem". However that speaks to his point - its creating not just messing with the edges. <a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/blog/principles-of-effective-research/" style="color: #1E1E1E;">Read it here</a></p>
