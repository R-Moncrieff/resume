                <p id="capability-text-light">Underpining Tesla's revenue growth to $19bn is Elon Musk's realisation that the unit price of lithium batteries would fall dramatically as production scaled.</p>
                <p id="capability-text-light">Underpining the $105,0000bn GDP growth over 20th century* was Riemann's realisation that when you said two lines were parallel you were also making an assuption about the shape of the world. <br><br> *See: modern maths, any theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamincs, Gödel's incompleteness theorem</p>

                <p>Deutsch does a good job of questioning the degree that our experiance of the world today is the product of knowledge acumulation. You would not survive the night without clothes in Oxfordshire. Clothes are knowledge.</p>
                <p>We can build a lot more knowledge. As we do our understanding of what is normal will change. Breathing in space will be as normal as surviving the night in Oxfordshire.</p>

                <p>Because it's wrong.</p>
                <p>Kant does a very good job of exploring the inconsistancies that develop when you try and base morality off universal rules.</p>
                <p>Gödel and Wittgenstein polish off this idea. But to really get a sense of scope of the scope of the errors Kant is invaluable.</p>
