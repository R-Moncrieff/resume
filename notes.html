                <p id="capability-text-light">Underpining the $105,0000bn GDP growth over 20th century* was Riemann's realisation that when you said two lines were parallel you were also making an assuption about the shape of the world. <br><br> *See: non-Euclidean geometry, any theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamincs, Gödel's incompleteness theorem..</p>

                <p>Deutsch does a good job of questioning the degree that our experiance of the world today is the product of knowledge acumulation. You would not survive the night without clothes in Oxfordshire. Clothes are knowledge.</p>
                <p>We can build a lot more knowledge. As we do our understanding of what is normal will change. Breathing in space will be as normal as surviving the night in Oxfordshire.</p>
                <p>He also explores how to evaluate theories. We don't have a perfect criteria for this and he does a good job of building intuition of how to evaluate in the interim.</p>

                <p>Because it's wrong. </p>
                <p>Kant does a very good job of exploring the inconsistancies that develop when you try and base morality off universal rules.</p>
                <p>Riemann, Gödel and Wittgenstein polish off this idea. But to really get a sense of the scope of the errors Kant is invaluable.</p>
                <p>If you haven't read this it's very likely that you are implicitly assuming that the universality he was aiming for is possible. It's not and it's worth finding out why.</p>

                <p>Probability is a very big deal. It's also very new - see above.</p>
                <p>For most of human history we have really really really not had any clue how to tackle this.</p>
                <p>Hacking charts the emergence of uncertainty and chance as ideas from ground zero. The constant rebasing of words is funky to read however it really hits home the point that these ideas are still stabilising.</p>
